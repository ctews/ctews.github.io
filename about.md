I am a mobile developer born in 1986 from Hamburg, Germany. I've got a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. in computer science, each of them were achieved at the [University Of Applied Science - FH Wedel](http://www.fh-wedel.de). Both of my thesis papers were about topics in the mobile development. The Bachelor thesis was about implementing an online fashion search plattform optimized for iPads and the Master thesis was about implementing an usability framework that helps you capturing and analyzing usability tests as well as producing tutorial or marketing videos for an iOS app.

## Current Job Position

Mobile Developer @ [Jimdo](http://jimdo.com)[^1]|

Years ago mobile apps were about features and productivity. Those key factors were the selling points of a mobile application. This changed in the last years and today it's not only about features, it is also about beautiful designs, a great UI and an intuitive UX combined in a rock solid app. This all combined is my passion for mobile development especially focusing on iOS.

<p><center>Above you can see an example video of the blog feature from the Jimdo iOS app.</center></p>

The main focus of my work at Jimdo is the construction of the [iOS app](http://de.jimdo.com/jimdo-app/). We've worked really hard on it and it was received well by both new and existing users (4,5 star average rating) and was featured in over 40 countries as well as nominated in the category ["Best Of 2013"](http://de.jimdo.com/2013/12/17/app-store-das-beste-aus-2013-jimdo-ist-dabei/) by Apple.|

## Sports Life

Apart from the business life I changed my mindset about living healthy back in 2011 where I had a lumbago with an age of 25. It was the result of being a developer sitting around the whole day eating junk food, drinking soft drinks and doing no kind of sports.|
  
After the lumbago I decided to get fit, eat clean and never let my body being a second choice. From one day to another I did a diet and started with a 6 day per week fitness workout called [P90X](http://www.beachbody.com/product/p90x-what-you-get.do). It was very effective and my body lost 10kg of weight in 3 month and another 8kg in the next 3 month.|
  
Impressed by the results I'm still working and mastered programs like Insanity, Insanity Asylum 1 & 2, Tapout XT, P90X3 and a little bit of Body Beast. So if you are a developer and reading this: Move your butt, eat clean and train like you mean it --- your won't get a second body in your life!


## Photographer Profiles

I started with DSLR photography early in 2014. Photography was always kind of impressing to me and some colleagues at Jimdo are into it since a couple of years and shooting awesome pictures. Because I planned a trip to the carribean I just wanted to be prepared to hold the memories of the beautiful landscapes and incredible sunsets. To realize wonderful images I bought a brand-new Pentax K-50 including two lenses to get the best out of my amateur hands and eyes. If you are interested in my personal interpretation of art just have a look at my Flickr or EyeEm stream.|
