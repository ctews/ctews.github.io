Years ago mobile apps were about features and productivity. Those key factors were the selling points of a mobile application. This changed in the last years and today it's not only about features, it is also about beautiful designs, a great UI and an intuitive UX combined in a rock solid app. This all combined is my passion for mobile development especially focusing on iOS.

## Current Job Position

Mobile Developer @ [Jimdo](http://jimdo.com)[^1]

The main focus of my work at Jimdo is the construction of the [iOS app](http://de.jimdo.com/jimdo-app/). We've worked really hard on it and it was received well by both new and existing users (4,5 star average rating) and was featured in over 40 countries as well as nominated in the category ["Best Of 2013"](http://de.jimdo.com/2013/12/17/app-store-das-beste-aus-2013-jimdo-ist-dabei/) by Apple.|

## Photographer Profiles

I started with DSLR photography early in 2014. Photography was always impressing to me and some colleagues at Jimdo are into it since a couple of years and shooting awesome pictures. Because I planned a trip to the carribean I just want to be prepared to hold the memories of the beautiful landscapes and romantic sunsets. To realize wonderfull images I bought a brand-new Pentax K-50 including two lenses to get the best out of my amateur hands and eyes. If you are interested in my personal interpretation of art just have a look at my Flickr or EyeEm stream.|
